title: Generic Formatter
tagline: Makes nested data readable with generic indentdation rules
description: Tools often spew out long errors that fill up my terminal and are completely unreadable. They contain a mixture of different formats (stringified Scala, JSON, etc.) and can't be formatted for readability by any specific formatter. This tool is designed to make any generic input considerably more readable.

<p>Why don't I just fix the underlying error handling? I do. Every time. Then someone breaks it a few weeks later and doesn't bother fixing it. I'm tired cleaning up after other people so at this point I'm just writing my own tooling to work around them.</p>
