# Web Tools

A collection of minorly useful text tooling

While some of these tools already exist online, you equally shouldn't be pasting confidential company data into random online tools. This site saves me relying on every machine I use having tools like [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) installed.

## Local setup

1. Fork + clone the project (consider using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) if you're unfamiliar with git)
2. Install [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), an open-source ruby-based static site generator
3. Open a terminal in the project directory
4. Run `jekyll serve`, which will automatically build and serve the site

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome. This could mean requesting features, reporting bugs or creating pull requests.

If you don't have or want a GitHub account you could drop me a line via Twitter ([@kittsville](https://twitter.com/kittsville)) or email (kittsville@gmail.com).

Please bear in mind there is a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) which defines acceptable behavior.
